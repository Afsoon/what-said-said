# Why Blog?

Why am I writing a blog in 2025? Because the blog is intended to be my personal wiki, but more organized and detailed, and a learning journal. I'm aware we are living in the era of articles generate by LLMs, and those articles to be SEO perfect that translate to more ad impressions. I'm not interested on monetize my blog, and less include ads.

Others would think it's old fashioned, but what I better way to learn than explain it.

I'm being realistic, my post won't be like so good as the people I follow, specially the first ones, but I don't care. Is this an excuse to do it bad? No, I'm going to do whatever under my hand to improve, English isn't my fist language, and as side effect I'm practicing my writing skills.

## Blog design

The design is based in the [Devon Govvet Blog](https://github.com/devongovett/blog/). As my main frontend framework is React, and his blog is based on React Server Component. This is the best excuse to get used to RSC and a very limited use case. I'm planning a redesign in the future, but I want to have the habit to write first than my ideal blog design.

## Content

Most of the content is going to be frontend and my journey of learning Rust, mixed with Clickhouse probably.

## TIL Section

I got this idea from [Simon Willison WebBlog](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/#tils). The idea is to write short post about something you have just learned, showing that no matter the years of experiencie you can always learn.

A TIL can be the trigger to a write a post, but it doesn't to be always like this.
