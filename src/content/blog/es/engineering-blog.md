# Astro Starter Kit: Engineering Blog

This template was built to easily create an engineering blog for one or multiple authors.

Demo: https://astro-engineering-blog.netlify.app/

## Getting started

```
npm create astro@latest -- --template eddyvinck/astro-engineering-blog
```

### Configuration

Edit the values in `src/consts.ts` to match your brand or company:

```ts
export const BRAND = "Acme";
export const SITE_TITLE = "Acme Engineering";
export const SITE_URL = "https://astro-engineering-blog.netlify.app";
export const SITE_DESCRIPTION = "Welcome to the Acme Engineering blog!";
export const PAGINATION_POSTS_PER_PAGE = 5;
```

Change any lines or add more in the `<head>` tags in `src/components/BaseHead.astro`, like the favicon:

```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
```

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## CLI Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |

| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
